                Hello there! My name is Liz Perry and I am currently studying to become a Full-Stack Developer! I am
                beyond excited and nervous
                to fully immerse myself in this career path, but I hope to showcase my artistic and technical skills
                all at once! I am very
                proud of myself for staying persistent throughout this very difficult course but I'm sure my work will
                speak for itself when
                completed! I have always had an artistic side, but just never felt comfortable with a paintbrush or a
                pencil to express myself. Ideas
                and concepts come to me so easily, but I've never been able to produce my vision. However, since I was
                little, I've always
                had a knack for technology and would be fascinated with how things work or how to fix them.
            </p>
            <p>
                This sense of curiousity coupled
                with my ability to learn things fairly quickly, has resulted in several years in the IT field. For the
                past few years I've
                had my artistic side on hold since network security has kept me very busy. However, recently I've
                realized it just doesn't scratch
                that itch for me anymore and I wanted to learn something new. I stumbled across web development and
                almost instantly became
                hooked. You're telling me I can create something aesthetically beautiful but also technical and highly
                functional with coding?
                Yes please! I can have the best of both worlds!
            </p>
            <p>
                So please feel free to browse through my portfolio and check out the work I've created along the way! I
                hope you enjoy! If you
                would like to contact me, please feel free to do so through the <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">contact</a>
                page!
